# Codebook

This codebook describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

## The data source

The data used in this project is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data is from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the researchers captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

## The variables

The variables in the tidy data set are the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The variables are listed below:

* subject: the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
* activity: the activity performed by the subject. It has 6 possible values:
  * WALKING
  * WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  * WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  * SITTING
  * STANDING
  * LAYING
* The rest of the variables are the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The variables are listed below:
